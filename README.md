# T-Distrbution
The t-distribution, also known as the Studentâ€™s t-distribution, is a type of probability distribution that is similar to the normal distribution with its bell shape but has heavier tails. It is used for estimating population parameters for small sample sizes or unknown variances. T-distributions have a greater chance for extreme values than normal distributions, and as a result have fatter tails.
The t-distribution is the basis for computing t-tests in statistics.
The t-distribution is a continuous probability distribution of the z-score when the estimated standard deviation is used in the denominator rather than the true standard deviation.
The t-distribution, like the normal distribution, is bell-shaped and symmetric, but it has heavier tails, which means that it tends to produce values that fall far from its mean.
T-tests are used in statistics to estimate significance.
